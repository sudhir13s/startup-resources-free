"""freellm — free-LLM router library.

Curated catalog of free-tier LLM / multimodal providers, with quota-aware
fallback routing so total spend stays at $0. Reusable as a library outside
this project; designed to graduate to its own PyPI package later.

Public API (v0.2 will fully implement; v0.1 ships the contract + dry-run
plan only):

    from freellm import (
        call_text, call_vision, call_image_gen, call_video_gen,
        call_embed, call_stt, call_tts,
        Result, Plan, ProviderEntry,
        AllProvidersExhaustedError,
    )

See `.claude/rules/project/freellm-router.md` for the full spec.
